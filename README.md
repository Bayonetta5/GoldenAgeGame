# GoldenAgeGame
An MMO made with irrlicht, cpp-httplib, and winsock udp sockets in Visual Studio 2017

The output folder is supposed to be configured and set up with the correct folders, and executable is to be ran from the ouput
directory so the working directory doesn't need to be changed.

Output Directories
- Client
- GameServer
- LoginServer 

You'll need httplib and openssl.
      
I just had to revert =(

figured why not make a repo so it doesn't happen again lol
