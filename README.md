# GoldenAgeGame
An MMO made with irrlicht, cpp-httplib, and winsock in Visual Studio 2017

The output folder is supposed to be configured and set up with the correct folders, and executable is to be ran from the ouput
directory so the working directory doesn't need to be changed.

You'll have to do some configuring if you want to mess with this.
